# Student tools integrator

This application is a part of my bachelor's degree. The main reason to build this app was that currently trying to organize student's life can be difficult. You have to use quite a few apps in order to have all needed functionalities: calendar, class schedule, creating notes for classes and so on. This app has all necessary functionalities built in, so it can become the only app you use daily for organization of your student's life. 

You can see it live and start using it here:
